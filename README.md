## Setup

```bash
# generate 10x v3 scRNA-seq test data
snakemake scrnaseq_10x_v3 --use-conda -c1 --conda-cleanup-pkgs cache

# test the workflow
snakemake all --use-conda -c1 --directory .test --show-failed-logs
```

## Usage

1. Create two TSVs: (1) a "runsheet" that describes each 10x run and (2) a "patientsheet" that describes each patient

The runsheet should have the following columns

1. `run_id`: a unique identifier for each run
2. `patient_id`: a unique identifier for each patient
3. `r1`: the path to the R1 fastq file
4. `r2`: the path to the R2 fastq file

The patientsheet should have the following columns

1. `patient_id`: a unique identifier for each patient
2. `condition`: the condition of the patient

3. Enter the paths to the runsheet and patientsheet in the `config.yaml` file. Specify an output directory.

```yaml
outdir: <path to output directory>
runsheet: <path to runsheet>
patientsheet: <path to patientsheet>
```

4. Run the workflow

```bash
# -c16 = use 16 cores, this can be changed to whatever you want
snakemake all --use-conda -c16--show-failed-logs
```

## Development tips

1. See issues for a list of things to do.
2. Choose an issue to work on
3. Create a branch for the issue
4. Make changes and commit them
5. Create a pull request to activate the testing workflow in Github Actions
6. Make additional changes if necessary, until tests pass
7. Once tests pass, request code review from @mikecuoco
8. Once reviews are all addressed, @mikecuoco will merge the pull request to the main branch!
